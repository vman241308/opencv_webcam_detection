# OpenCV-Webcam
A simple OpenCV learning project to stream video from a webcam. 

Has an option to save a frame to disk every n seconds. Press H to enable background subtraction, F toggles Morphological filtering of foreground mask.

Hackishly supports passed commandline parameters. First paramter is frame save interval, second the ID of the camera device to use and the third the window scaling factor.
